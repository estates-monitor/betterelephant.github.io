<div class="entry-content"><p>A <a href="http://www.spinwatch.org/index.php/component/k2/item/5458-the-local-lobby-and-the-failure-of-democracy">report</a> by <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/reconfiguration-london-akin-social-cleansing">journalist Anna Minton</a> has uncovered conflicts of interest and what she describes as a revolving door between council officials and developers at the Elephant &amp; Castle.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8244/8637497136_d25afc426a.jpg"></p>

<p>The report reveals a number of former council officers involved in negotiations with developer Lend Lease for the <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/2013/02/southwark-council-accidentally-leaks-confidential-information-about-controversial-heygate-re">controversial sale</a> of the Heygate estate, who have left the council and are now full-time employees of Lend Lease corporation.</p>

<p>Tom subsequently left the Council in 2011 to start work directly for Lend Lease, where he is now Development Manager for the Elephant &amp; Castle project.</p>

<p></br>
Beyond the Council&#8217;s senior planning &amp; regeneration team officers who have defected to the private development sector, a more than significant number of Council members have also slinked through Southwark&#8217;s revolving doors:</p>

<p><img class="left" src="http://www.fourcommunications.com/sites/default/files/styles/four_square/public/people/jeremy.png">After Labour lost to the Lib Dems in 2002, both the former Labour Council Leader (Jeremy Fraser - left), Southwark&#8217;s Councillor for Regeneration (Steve Lancashire) and Lambeth Labour&#8217;s <a href="http://www.lambeth.gov.uk/moderngov/mgUserInfo.aspx?UID=165">Jim Dickson</a> teamed up to <a href="http://www.southwarknews.co.uk/00,news,10971,440,00.htm">found a consultancy</a> offering developers <em>&#8220;political support in the face of public opposition&#8221;</em> to their planning proposals. The company they founded is called <a href="http://www.fourcommunications.com/">&#8216;Four Communications&#8217;</a> and has assisted developers on a <a href="http://betterelephant.org/blog/2014/10/19/gamekeepers-turned-poachers/">large number</a> of high-profile South Bank developments.</p>

On Stanton&#8217;s profile page for the company he writes <em>&#8220;I enjoy working on strategic allocations enabling controversial sites to come forward for development.&#8221;</em></p>

<p>Under his list of major accomplishments he boasts <em>&#8220;Winning approval at committee for a major development on a greenfield site&#8221;</em> Amongst others, Curtin is currently advising developers on the controversial <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/lib-dem-deputy-investigated-over-lobbying-8395968.html">Southwark Metals development</a> in Bermondsey for which Stanton&#8217;s party received a donation.</p>

<p>With <a href="http://35percent.org/heygate-regeneration-faq/">controversy</a> mounting about the deals being done with developers in Southwark, serious questions are starting to be asked about conflicts of interest and integrity of those supposed to be acting in the council&#8217;s best interest.</p>
